# To-Do Website

## Overview

This To-Do website is a project built using Strapi for managing user data and APIs, and React for the frontend. The application allows users to manage their to-do items with a focus on user authentication and data validation.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and manage their to-do items. If a user is not logged in, they cannot access the to-do functionality.
- **Data Management**: The app uses Strapi to handle user data and to-do items.
- **Data Validation**: Validation is implemented to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
- **Routing and Protection**: React Router DOM is used for navigation, with protected routes that prevent unauthorized access.
- **Custom Hooks**: Custom hooks are created to avoid code repetition, simplifying API calls and data handling.
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Interfaces are used to enforce data structure and types for better code quality and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, React Router DOM
- **Backend**: Strapi
- **Validation**: Yup
- **API Requests**: Axios
- **TypeScript**: For defining interfaces
- **Custom Hooks**: For managing API calls and state

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OmarEhab262/StrapiTodoApp.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Strapi**

   Follow the Strapi documentation to set up and configure the Strapi backend. Ensure you have the necessary collections and permissions configured for user authentication and to-do management.

4. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1337/api` to see the application in action.

## Usage

- **Registration and Login**: Access the registration and login pages to create or access your account.
- **To-Do Management**: Once logged in, you can add, edit, and delete your to-do items.
- **Protected Routes**: If you are not logged in, you will be redirected to the login page when attempting to access the to-do functionality.

## Custom Hooks

- **useApi**: A custom hook for making API requests using Axios.
- **useAuth**: A custom hook for managing authentication and user state.

## Conclusion

This To-Do website project demonstrates a full-stack application using React for the frontend and Strapi for the backend. With features such as user authentication, data validation, and protected routes, the app provides a robust and secure platform for managing to-do items.

The project is organized with separate repositories for the frontend and backend, ensuring clear separation of concerns and easier maintenance. The React app handles user interactions and displays to-do items, while Strapi manages the backend operations and data storage.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and customize this project to suit your needs. Whether youâ€™re looking to enhance your skills with full-stack development or build upon this foundation, this project offers a solid starting point.
